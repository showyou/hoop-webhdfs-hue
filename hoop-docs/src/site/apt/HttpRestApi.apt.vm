Hoop, Hadoop HDFS over HTTP ${project.version} - HTTP REST API

  \[ {{{index.html}Go Back}} \]

* Security

  Hoop enforces authentication using {{{http://github.com/cloudera/alfredo}Alfredo}}.
  Out of the box Alfredo supports both pseudo authentication and Kerberos HTTP
  SPNEGO authentication.

** Pseudo Authentication

  With pseudo authentication the user name must be specified in the
  <<<user.name=\<USERNAME\>>>> query string parameter of a Hoop URL.
  For example:

+---+
$ curl "http://<HOOP_HOST>:14000?op=homedir&user.name=babu"
+---+

** Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO Authentication

  Kerberos HTTP SPENGO authentication requires a tool or library supporting
  Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO protocol.

  IMPORTANT: If using <<<curl>>>, the <<<curl>>> version being used must support
  GSS (<<<curl -V>>> prints out 'GSS' if it supports it).

  For example:

+---+
$ kinit
Please enter the password for tucu@LOCALHOST:
$ curl --negotiate -u foo "http://<HOOP_HOST>:14000?op=homedir"
Enter host password for user 'foo':
+---+

  NOTE: the <<<-u USER>>> option is required by the <<<--negotiate>>> but it is
  not used. Use any value as <<<USER>>> and when asked for the password press
  [ENTER] as the password value is ignored.

** {Remembering Who I Am} (Establishing an Authenticated Session)

  As most authentication mechanisms, Alfredo authenticates users once and issues
  a short-lived authentication token to be presented in subsequent requests. This
  authentication token is a signed HTTP Cookie.

  When using tools like <<<curl>>>, the authentication token must be stored on
  the first request doing authentication, and submitted in subsequent requests.
  To do this with curl the <<<-b>>> and <<<-c>>> options to save and send HTTP
  Cookies must be used.

  For example, the first request doing authentication should save the received
  HTTP Cookies.

    Using Pseudo Authentication:

+---+
$ curl -b ~/.hoopauth "http://<HOOP_HOST>:14000?op=homedir&user.name=babu"
+---+

    Using Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO authentication:

+---+
$ curl --negotiate -u foo -b ~/.hoopauth "http://<HOOP_HOST>:14000?op=homedir"
+---+

  Then, subsequent requests forward the previously received HTTP Cookie:

+---+
$ curl -c ~/.hoopauth "http://<HOOP_HOST>:14000?op=list"
+---+

* File System Operations

  The HTTP REST API is fully demonstrated below using the Unix <<<curl>>>
  command.

  HOOP HTTP status codes follow HTTP guidelines.

  HOOP payload responses are in JSON format.

  For optional parameters, the default values are between '*', for example
  'overwrite=*true*|false'.

  All the Examples below assume the User is already already authenticated, refer to the
  {{{Remembering_Who_I_Am}Remembering Who I Am}} section.
